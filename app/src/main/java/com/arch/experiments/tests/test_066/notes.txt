DONE:
 Successful initial implementation of scoping

TODO:

    AndroidMachines#createMachine is kinda coupled with the MVP structure,
        it needs to be clearly separated
    Maybe move scope handler to base fragment
    ScopeHandler:
        - Needs more methods to for clearing, because
            what if you want to keep tracking states, but not update them in view?
        - addLinkedMachines implementation is lousy
